# FTP Brute Force Login Script

A Python script that performs a brute-force attack on FTP servers using the `rockyou.txt` wordlist. The script automatically detects the local machine's IP address as the FTP server and attempts to log in with a given username and multiple passwords from the wordlist. The script connects on port 21, the default FTP port.

## Features:
- **Automatic Server Detection**: The script detects the local machineâ€™s IP address as the FTP server.
- **Wordlist-based Brute Force**: Uses `rockyou.txt` for password attempts.
- **Port 21 Support**: Connects to FTP on port 21, the default FTP port.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback on success or failure for each password attempt.
